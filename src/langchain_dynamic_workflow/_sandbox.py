"""Per-leaf sandbox isolation, identity derivation, and lifecycle management.

A leaf ``agent()`` that needs execution (shell / code) runs against an isolated
backend rather than sharing one mutable workspace with its siblings. The default
isolation granularity is per-leaf, and a leaf's sandbox identity is derived from
its content-hash journal key — the same key that drives result memoization. That
single source of identity gives four properties at once: retry stability (a leaf
that re-runs maps to the same sandbox), resume stability (a replayed run resolves
the same identity), uniqueness (distinct leaf calls never collide), and self
consistency with journal dedup (identity and cache key cannot drift apart).

Pure-reasoning leaves (``needs_execution=False``) are not allocated a sandbox at
all; they use an ephemeral state-backed store. The number of *active sandboxes*
therefore tracks the number of execution leaves, never the number of logical
agents — a workflow with many reasoning leaves allocates zero of them.
